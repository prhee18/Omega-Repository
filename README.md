Our project idea is to create an application to help customers to identify the location in the TCU Campus bookstore of the merchandise they're searching for. 
The TCU Campus store is a store located next to TCU that sells books, clothing, merchandise, and electronics. Currently if you are searching for a specific item at the campus store you can identify if it is in stock but not where the location is at within the bookstore. 
This application will take the customers item input and present a map of the bookstore that has the location of all items. The user will be prompted to select a radio button indicating where they are in the store and then select checkboxes of which items they want to buy. Then, the application will output a detailed instruction of how to get around the campus store that saves them time.  
The benefits will help customers improve efficiency for customers who are searching for a specific item and help minimize customer traffic during busy times.
